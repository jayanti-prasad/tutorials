1. R can be used either with R commeand prompt which can be invoked with :

$R

or can be run from a script with :

$Rscript hello.r

2. There is a lot of help available which can be found in one of the 
following ways:

a) If we want to know more about the function 'sum' we can give the 
following input to 'R' command prompt :

> ?sum
> ?read.table


b) Help option also works well :

> help(sum)
help.search("data input")

c)  The find function tells you what package something
is in:

> find("mean")
[1] "package:base"

d)  apropos returns a character vector giving the names of all objects in the search list that match your
(potentially partial) enquiry:
> apropos("mean")
 [1] ".colMeans"     ".rowMeans"     "colMeans"      "kmeans"       
 [5] "mean"          "mean.Date"     "mean.default"  "mean.difftime"
 [9] "mean.POSIXct"  "mean.POSIXlt"  "rowMeans"      "weighted.mean"

we can find more about a specific function with :
> help(colMeans 

e) Worked examples of functions
> example(lm)

3. Smallest code to plot :

# create Gaussian data 
x <- stats::rnorm(1000)

# set the name of the output file 
pdf(file="myplot.pdf")

# plot 
plot(x)

5. CTRL-L clear space

6. Clear all the variables 


7. Statistics 
r is the generic prefix for random variable generator such as runif(), rnorm().
d is the generic prefix for the probability density function such as dunif(), dnorm().
p is the generic prefix for the cumulative density function such as punif(), pnorm().
q is the generic prefix for the quantile function such as qunif(), qnorm().
